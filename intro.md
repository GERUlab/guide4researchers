# Welcome to your guide for your Master's thesis, Version 2025-2026

You are about to embark on the great adventure of your thesis project! This project represents a crucial and significant step in your academic journey. It embodies the culmination of your years of learning and training, showcasing the knowledge, skills, and abilities you have acquired throughout your university studies.

As a final project, this thesis will allow you to demonstrate your mastery of the subject you have chosen, as well as your ability to conduct in-depth research, critically analyze information, and present clear and relevant conclusions. It is also an opportunity to put into practice the theories and concepts you have learned by applying them to a concrete problem or conducting original research.

The MFE also aims to further develop transferable skills such as time management, organization, bibliographic research, scientific writing, and oral presentation. These skills are valuable for your future professional career.

Beyond the academic aspect, the thesis represents an opportunity to stand out and make your mark in your field of study. It can be a springboard for future opportunities, such as publications, conference presentations, or even job offers.

The MFE is therefore much more than just an academic requirement. It can embody your personal achievement, the culmination of your educational journey, and serve as a platform to develop and showcase your skills and knowledge. It is a project that positions you as an expert in your field and allows you to take a first step toward what we hope will be a promising career.

This small guide provides you with some instructions and tools necessary for the successful completion of your project. It is important that you familiarize yourself with it and keep it in mind throughout the year.

We welcome your feedbacks and any other relevant tips and tools that we wouldn't have thought of to help the next generation of researchers !

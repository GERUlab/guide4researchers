# Working Environment, Supervision, and Collaborations

You ARE undertaking your thesis project within the Earth and Life Institute â€“ Environmental Sciences (ELIE) department. We encourage you to take advantage of this working environment to interact with experts in your field of study, exchange ideas, and receive constructive feedback and advice. By collaborating with professors, researchers, and other students, you can engage in a stimulating and enriching environment.**

## Welcome Lunch
ELIE organizes a welcome lunch at the beginning of the academic year. You will receive an invitation soon. This event is also an opportunity to create connections and introduce you to other important aspects related to your thesis project and our research department. Your attendance is highly recommended.

## Reference Persons
Most thesis topics are part of ongoing research projects. As such, the majority of you will have one or more researchers associated with the ELIE group. These researchers are your first point of contact for questions related to your thesis project, so don't hesitate to reach out to them, while respecting their time and availability. Please prioritize scheduling meetings to allow the researcher to organize their time effectively.

## Open-space
An open-space is available to you on the 3rd floor of the Serre building to provide a pleasant working environment and facilitate interactions with other thesis students, researchers, and professors at ELIE. You are strongly encouraged to use this workspace as soon as possible.

## Coffee Breaks and Lunch
You are welcome to join the coffee breaks (10:30-11:00) and lunch breaks. Informal interactions in the hallways and cafeterias are very important for sparking or developing ideas and solving problems.

## Thesis Management
For several years, we have noticed that many thesis students do not make sufficient progress on their thesis before February of the academic year. This compromises the quality of their final work and places a burden on supervision and reviews. To avoid such issues, each student is required to meet the deadlines provided in the Gantt Chart available in Teams. Please note that these deadlines are in addition to [those for accompanying seminars, submission and presentation of the thesis, and administrative deadlines communicated by the School](https://intranet.uclouvain.be/fr/myucl/facultes/agro/memoire-fin-etudes-masters-bioingenieur.html#7.%20Travail%20%C3%A9crit). Meeting these deadlines will allow you to have an advanced understanding of your study topic and a clear vision of how to carry it out. You will be well-equipped to conduct experiments, models, and analyses during the second semester... and perhaps even submit your thesis in June?!

## Group Meetings and Office Hours
We organize weekly group meetings to discuss each person's progress and questions as a team. I will also block a 3-hour period each week during which we can meet one-on-one if necessary to discuss your progress or questions in more depth. You can schedule an appointment during the reserved time. It is your responsibility to determine when a meeting is needed. Be proactive! Please prepare well for these meetings (possibly with a PowerPoint presentation illustrating a problem/result). A well-prepared meeting is worth two! Details regarding meetings and office hours will be communicated at the start of the academic year.

## Thesis Accompaniment Seminars
Two thesis accompaniment seminars will be held during the first and second semesters. You will be contacted to organize these seminar sessions and to explain the modalities.

## Literature Review
  The specific questions addressed in a thesis project (MFE) are defined by first conducting a synthesis of the knowledge, also known as the "state of the art." A state of the art is a detailed analysis of existing research on a specific topic. It allows you to catalog, synthesize, and evaluate current knowledge in the field. This is a crucial step to position the research project within the scientific context, identify gaps, and guide the direction of the thesis. It helps formulate relevant research questions and contributes to advancing knowledge in the studied field.
  
  To conduct a thorough state of the art, it is necessary to know how to perform rigorous bibliographic research. You can do this via [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/), among others. Please refer to the documents and resources below for a reminder of other tools and sources of information available, and familiarize yourself with the procedures and best practices.

  Also, note that you can ask your supervisor to purchase (e-)books that you cannot find in these libraries.

## Reference Manager
  A reference manager such as Zotero allows for more efficient management of academic literature. Such a program helps collect, organize, and manage bibliographic references effectively. It also facilitates the search and extraction of relevant data. Furthermore, it allows you to automatically generate citations and bibliographies that comply with citation standards in your thesis document, whether in Word or LaTeX. Its use is essential.

 ## Scientific Writing
  A thesis is a scientific document and must therefore adhere to the writing standards for such documents. Although longer than a scientific article, it is advisable to aim for a structure and writing style that closely resemble that of a scientific paper. We therefore encourage you to familiarize yourself with the standards and advice for good scientific writing using the following resources:

## Word or LaTeX?
  You can write your document in MS Word or LaTeX. If you choose to work in LaTeX, consider using the online editor [OverLeaf](https://www.overleaf.com).

## Grammar and Syntax
  Use machine learning applications to check your grammar. Consider, for example, the standard functions of MS Word, as well as additional plugins such as [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/)) if you are writing in English, or Antidote. If you are writing in English, you can also use ChatGPT to improve grammar and syntax. Start by writing the text yourself and ask ChatGPT to correct your English. However, do not ask ChatGPT to generate the content, of course!
